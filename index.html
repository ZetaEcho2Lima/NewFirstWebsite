    <h4>Coding Experience</h4>
  <!-- organizing different interest and experience with lists. I first utilize a statement, followed by an ordered list for the different expereicne I have with coding.-->
  <p>Though only getting started recently, my past experience with coding includes:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Two Computer Science Classes in Undergrad</p></li>
  <li><p>Dabbling in HTML while trying to create a website in late Highschool</p></li>
  <li><p>Thinkful's prep course covering Javascript and HTML/CSS basics.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Other Interests</h4>
    <!-- Same thing, following a heading 4, but instead of an ordered list, these are just bullets - an unordered list.-->
  <p>Generally speaking, most my interests are fairly nerdy:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Board games, video games, and reading sci-fi or fantasy novels</p></li>
  <li><p>Whittling/Woodworking</p></li><ul>
     <li><p>I have a temporary workshop right now, so I am limited in the work I can do to small crafts. Still, always good for decompression!</p></li>
