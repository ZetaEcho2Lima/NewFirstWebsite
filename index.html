    <h3>Hi! I'm Kaleb!</h3>
    <p>I am currently a student at the Thinkful bootcamp, looking to transfer to Software Development from my attorney career. My passion for web development emerged from knowing that I can reach so many more people with my efforts than I was able to as an attorney. I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and have been here for about 5 years. I orginially moved up here for law school.</p></div></section>
  
  <!-- For this section, I separated out the classes, calling them with both a section and a div in order to properly end them. I needed the centering to stop before the box element. -->

    <h4>Coding Experience</h4>
  <!-- organizing different interest and experience with lists. I first utilize a statement, followed by an ordered list for the different expereicne I have with coding.-->
  <p>I've thoroughly enjoyed the coding experiences I've had thus far. The challenge is refreshing. Though only getting started recently, my past experience with coding includes:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Two Computer Science Classes in Undergrad</p></li>
  <li><p>Dabbling in HTML while trying to create a website in late Highschool</p></li>
  <li><p>Thinkful's prep course covering Javascript and HTML/CSS basics.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Other Interests</h4>
    <!-- Same thing, following a heading 4, but instead of an ordered list, these are just bullets - an unordered list.-->
  <p>Generally speaking, most my interests are fairly nerdy:</p>
  <ul><li><p>Board games, video games, and reading sci-fi or fantasy novels</p></li>
  <li><p>Whittling/Woodworking</p></li>
    <li><p>Reading law updates for fields of interest</p></li></ul>
